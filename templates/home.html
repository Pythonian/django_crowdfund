This quest for essence is not novel. It is a path that has been treaded for aeons by our kind — sometimes the trail is brutal, other times it leaves behind beautiful patterns. And we continue to make these stories — good or bad — true or imagined. It tells us who we are — and what we can become. It becomes the cord that binds our humanity together. It is what makes us humans.

                            <strong>When Will I Be Famous?</strong> is a collection of 15 short stories — mostly set in Nigeria with a trove of themes like Football Trafficking, Politics, Criminal Justice System, Mental Health, Migration to Domestic Violence, Religion and Politics.

                            The tales teeter along the excruciating path of the dreamer — floats in the canal of the lost, delves into the illusion that the mind can be subsumed in and still manages to emerge on the other side of triumph — but not without scars.

                            <div class="crowdfund-underline crowdfund-underline-small"></div>
                            <p class="">
                                For this campaign, we have a funding goal of $25,000 or its naira equivalent which is going to last for 50 days (October 12 to November 30 2020) after which we will start after fulfilling the orders that we get from the campaign. We are crowdfunding this book for a couple of reasons. 
                            </p>
                            <p>(1) Publishing Costs: The funds we raise will help meet basic publishing costs for ISBN, book cover design, galley design, professional editor fees, creation of a website for crowdfunding and book sales and printing of the initial 200 copies from a US Printer. Print-On-Demand (POD) technology not only assures quality but also ensures the book is available for sales on Amazon and around the world.
                            </p>
                                <p>(2) Marketing Costs. We want to market this book majorly online while driving engagement and sales through social media and the book’s website. We want to ensure the book is well optimized on Amazon to make sales. I plan to hire an Amazon book sales expert in this regard. 
                                </p>
                                <p>(3) Living Costs: I live majorly on freelancing gigs but I intend to take a break doing that to focus on my next book — nonfiction which was inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic. I want to give this work all the concentration it would require so that I can meet my deadline. One of the banes of the creative is when you still have to worry about bills when you are working on a book. It tends to stifle your muse and also bog you down. So this would be the equivalent of me getting a grant! We will be able to fund the researches and put all the exigencies in place for the next book project.</p>

                                We are in a very challenging moment right now across the world with the Covid-19 scourge. People are losing jobs and the economy is biting hard. We are embarking on this project with all sensitivity as our collective good transcends any project. Asides the sheer altruistic gesture of supporting this campaign, we will be adding some rewards which are accentuated with every level of the pledges. We can’t pay you back for chipping into this cause — but we’ll try. Asides the copy of the book and my first book (for Nigerian backers only because of shipping costs), I’ll be offering voiceover services, book services (if you want to publish your book), website building (this is a good time to have an online presence!), promotional videos as perks as you pledge. I have partnered with exceptionally talented young people who would deliver these things to you at a great value. So it won’t just be that you are supporting this project, but you are also going to get a good deal for these services you won’t get elsewhere. We are sorry if these perks don’t impress you!

                                My first stint in publishing was eight years ago. Back then, I did some sort of crowdfunding and gathered just about enough money to publish. I was just following my instinct as a young man with a dose of exuberance —knocking on every door like a desperate politician on the campaign trail!

                                                We are currently editing the second draft of the book and we will be processing the orders we get by the end of the campaign on the 15th of October 2020. The book will be printed and shipped for paperbacks. The digital download will also be processed for different versions and an email will be sent to you to download it when ready.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The gears will also be sent to you together with the book and all that you have in the pledge.
                                                Please note that people outside Nigeria will not be able to get a physical copy of my first book, The “OBAMA” in You! because of the shipping costs.

                                                They will, however, get the digital copy of the book. (The book can be purchased on Amazon using this link.)
